hash tables
that's a concise and accurate summary. A hash table is composed of an array of indices, and each index is associated with a linked list. This combination allows the hash table to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs even in the presence of collisions. The linked lists handle collisions by allowing multiple key-value pairs to be stored at the same index. This structure, known as separate chaining, is a common approach for handling collisions in hash tables.
